## SMU Data Science Bootcamp VBA Scripting Homework

VBA script created to loop through all the stocks for each year and output the following information:

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

Conditional formatting was applied that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

The script was developed on a smaller sample size to reduce runtimes. [Test Data](Submission/alphabetical_testing.xlsm) and [VBA Script](Submission/VBA_Code.txt)

Screen shots provided to show the final output on the yearly reports. [Screen shots](Submission/Report_and_Screenshots.docx)
